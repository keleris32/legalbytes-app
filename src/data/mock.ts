    judgement_delivered: `This action was commenced on the 7th day of December 2015 by way of Motion on Notice dated the 4th day of December 2015, wherein Counsel on behalf of the Applicant prayed this Court for an Order of Certorari for the following: 1. To Quash the decision of the Respondent made against the Applicant suspending her from her duties on half pay as contained in the letter dated the 12th day of October, 2015 referenced FDN/R/P/SS/983/213 attached to this Application. 2. An injunction restraining the Respondent, its servants, officers, agents, or any other person howsoever, who may be claiming to act in its stead pending the hearing and determination of this application. The application was brought on the following grounds: i. The Respondent issued the said letter of suspension without valid authority. ii. The alleged Misconduct took place before the Council of the Respondent which concluded on the matter at its sitting of 23rd June 2014. iii. The Council was later dissolved on or about July 2015. iv. There was no Council in existence at the time the letter of suspension was issued. v. The letter of Query dated 1st September 2014 was authored by a different body that did not function on the matter and never witnessed the alleged misconduct but long after Council, the body that dealt with the alleged misconduct had completed action on the matter. vi. The letter of suspension is a double punishment on the same set of facts after an apology was given and accepted by the Council. In support of this application is a 35 paragraph affidavit accompanied by 8 exhibits, deposed to by the Applicant. In arguing this application, counsel filed a written address wherein he raised the following issues: 1. Whether the alleged misconduct has not been completely dealt with by the Council on 23rd June 2014. 2. Assuming but without conceding, that the allegation still subsists, whether the Rector can competently act for a non-existing Council. 3. Whether the letter of suspension does not amount to punishing the Applicant twice on the same set of facts. On issue one, counsel submitted that the allegation against the Applicant has been completely dealt with by the dissolved Council of the Respondent. He submitted that this current punishment of suspension and payment of half salary amounts to revisiting a completed act. Counsel relied on the case of OSHOBOJA vs. AMID & ORS (2009) LPELR-2803 (SC) where it was held that it is an application of the rule of public policy and in the interest of the common good that there should be an end to litigation. He argued that in the present case, the Council is superior and higher in hierarchy to the Rector's authority. It is an administrative indiscipline and act of impunity for the Rector to reopen what has been concluded by the council. See also ARO vs. FABOLUDE (1983) 2 SC 9 at 83 and CHIEF ADOMBA & 3 ORS. vs. ODIESE & 3 ORS. (1990) 1 NWLR (Pt. 125) 165 at 178. Counsel submitted further that the Rector purported to act in excess of her authority. This is owing to the fact that there was no place in the Council's meeting that it recommended any further punishment or any issue at all on the meeting to the Rector or any other authority. He urged the Court to consider the same malice shown by the Rector in the earlier application before this court in Suit No. NICN/OW/67/2014. In the circumstance counsel urged the court to hold that issue number one has been answered in the affirmative and therefore succeeds. On issue number two, the Court was urged to take judicial notice of a known fact that Boards and Council of Federal Government Parastatal and Institutions were dissolved in July 2015.Therefore at the time the Rector purported to act there was no council in existence. Also,the letter of suspension did not indicate any misconduct. It was issued for an "alleged misconduct"of "express orders forbidding wire-tapping devices" where no such express or oral order existed. Counsel submitted that section 17 (2) Federal Polytechnic Act 2004 Cap F17 does not apply in the instant case because no one has determined that there was a misconduct. If there was one, but without conceding the Council under Section 17(1) had dealt with and therefore the Rector's opinion or discretion is ousted. Secondly, the alleged act even if is true does not amount to a misconduct under the Act. Again, it is the submission of Counsel that the Applicant who is senior staff in a statutorily regulated employment can only be regulated and guided according to that statute. See the following cases: 1. SANUSI vs. ALHAJI AYOOLA & ORS. (1992) NWLR (Pt. 265) 275 2. FEDERAL MEDICAL CENTRE ADO EKITTI & 2 ORS vs. OMIDIORA KOLAWALE (2012) All FWLR (Pt. 653) 1999 at 2011. 3. BAMGBOYE vs. UNILORIN & ANOR (1999) 10 NWLR (Pt. 622) 290 Counsel submitted that the Rector cannot lawfully act for a dissolved council; she cannot also substitute her opinion for the provisions of the Act. She lacks the vires to do so. This issue, counsel submitted should be resolved in favour of the Applicant. Finally, it is the argument of Counsel that it amounts to double jeopardy to have the Applicant suspended from her duties on half salary despite having been made to apologize and which apology was accepted by the Council, her phone and the so called wire-tapping device confiscated and later returned to her. He submitted further that the law seriously frowns at punishing an offender twice on the same set of facts. See the case of NIGERIAN ARMY vs. AMINU KANO (2010) LPELR-2013 SC. Counsel urged the Court to resolve this last issue again in favour of the Applicant and grant all the reliefs of the Applicant by quashing the suspension letter of 12th October 2015, recall the Applicant to her duties with the Respondent, and order the payment of her salaries and entitlement illegally deducted from her by the Respondent. In opposition, the respondent's counsel filed a 25 paragraph Counter affidavit deposed to by Amanze Honourine Nneka (Mrs.), an Assistant Registrar with the respondent. In the accompanying written address, counsel distilled a sole issue for determination, which is: Whether the Rector of the Respondent institution acted within the enabling Rules of the contract of service the Applicant had with the Respondent in the manner the Applicant was suspended on 13th October 2015. Counsel argued that the Applicant was wrong in its submission that the Respondents Rector had no power to suspend an employee of the Polytechnic whether at all or in the manner and circumstance of this case. See paragraphs 4(b)(i)(ii), 4(c)(i), 12 and 23 of the Counter Affidavit. He argued further that the issue in this matter is pre-trial and not post-trial suspension and the Rules governing its contract of employment has a provision for pre-trial suspension and vests the power to impose such pre-trial suspension on two Authorities of the Respondent Polytechnic viz; (a) The Governing Council - See Section 17 (3) of the Federal Polytechnic Act 2004. (b) The Rector - See also Section 17 (2) Federal Polytechnic Act 2004.s`,
