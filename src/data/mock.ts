      "The claimant took up a complaint dated and filed on 13th September 2011 against the defendants praying for ' a) A declaration that the defendants' refusal to sign the contract agreement between them and the claimant is illegal, unlawful and calculated to defraud the claimant. b) A declaration that the defendants' refusal to sign the contract agreement is contrary to the international labour best practice and it amounts to an unfair labour practice. c) A declaration that the failure of the defendants to comply with the terms of the unsigned contract agreement is a fundamental breach of the contract of employment between the defendants and the claimant. d) A declaration that the advertorial publication in the Nigerian Tribune of Wednesday 2nd of January 2008 was done mala fide and calculated to pass off the image and good will of the claimant as an hotelier of international repute. e) An order compelling the defendants to pay the sum of $7,000 (Seven Thousand US Dollars) being the claimant's salary for the month of December 2007. f) An order compelling the defendants to pay the sum of $14,000 (Fourteen Thousand US Dollars) being two (2) months; salary in lieu of notice. g) An order compelling the defendants to pay the sum of $34,000 (Thirty-Four Thousand US Dollars) being the short fall on the claimant's salary between the month of June 2006 and November 2007. h) An order compelling the defendants to pay the sum of N250,000 (Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand Naira) being the cost of his return ticket to Israel. i) An order compelling the defendants to pay the sum of N5,000,000 (Five Million Naira) as damages for passing off the claimant's goodwill and images as an hotelier of international repute. j) General damages against the defendants in favour of the claimant for discomfort, inconvenience, embarrassment and ridicule occasioned by the defendants; advertorial publication as contained in the Nigerian Tribune of 2nd January 2008 at pages 20 and 21. Accompanying the complaint is the statement of facts, a list of witnesses and a list of 11 documents to be relied upon together with copies of the documents. In reaction, the defendants entered appearance by filing their memorandum of appearance dated 13th October 2011 but filed on 14th October 2011. The defendants also filed a motion on notice brought pursuant to Order 11 Rule 1 of the National Industrial Court (NIC) Rules 2007 and section 7(1)(a), (b) and (c) of the NIC Act 2006 praying the Court strike out the suit for want of jurisdiction. The defendants, however, did not join issues with the claimant by filing their statement of defence and the accompanying defence processes. In a considered ruling at its sitting of 1st February 2012, this Court ruled that the preliminary objection of the defendants lacked merit and so the Court has the jurisdiction to hear the claims of the claimant in virtue of section 254C of the 1999 Constitution, amended. The defendants were then asked to pay the cost of N20,000 (Twenty Thousand Naira) before the next adjourned date. The Court then ordered that the matter shall proceed to hearing. The Court had, however, at its sitting of 26th October 2011 suo motu raised the issue of its jurisdiction and competence to hear and determine the claims as to reliefs d), i) and j) of the claimant's complaint; whereupon the claimant, at the Court's sitting of 6th December 2011, orally applied to have the said reliefs d), i) and j) struck out. This the Court did.",

    judgement_delivered: `This action was commenced on the 7th day of December 2015 by way of Motion on Notice dated the 4th day of December 2015, wherein Counsel on behalf of the Applicant prayed this Court for an Order of Certorari for the following: 1. To Quash the decision of the Respondent made against the Applicant suspending her from her duties on half pay as contained in the letter dated the 12th day of October, 2015 referenced FDN/R/P/SS/983/213 attached to this Application. 2. An injunction restraining the Respondent, its servants, officers, agents, or any other person howsoever, who may be claiming to act in its stead pending the hearing and determination of this application. The application was brought on the following grounds: i. The Respondent issued the said letter of suspension without valid authority. ii. The alleged Misconduct took place before the Council of the Respondent which concluded on the matter at its sitting of 23rd June 2014. iii. The Council was later dissolved on or about July 2015. iv. There was no Council in existence at the time the letter of suspension was issued. v. The letter of Query dated 1st September 2014 was authored by a different body that did not function on the matter and never witnessed the alleged misconduct but long after Council, the body that dealt with the alleged misconduct had completed action on the matter. vi. The letter of suspension is a double punishment on the same set of facts after an apology was given and accepted by the Council. In support of this application is a 35 paragraph affidavit accompanied by 8 exhibits, deposed to by the Applicant. In arguing this application, counsel filed a written address wherein he raised the following issues: 1. Whether the alleged misconduct has not been completely dealt with by the Council on 23rd June 2014. 2. Assuming but without conceding, that the allegation still subsists, whether the Rector can competently act for a non-existing Council. 3. Whether the letter of suspension does not amount to punishing the Applicant twice on the same set of facts. On issue one, counsel submitted that the allegation against the Applicant has been completely dealt with by the dissolved Council of the Respondent. He submitted that this current punishment of suspension and payment of half salary amounts to revisiting a completed act. Counsel relied on the case of OSHOBOJA vs. AMID & ORS (2009) LPELR-2803 (SC) where it was held that it is an application of the rule of public policy and in the interest of the common good that there should be an end to litigation. He argued that in the present case, the Council is superior and higher in hierarchy to the Rector's authority. It is an administrative indiscipline and act of impunity for the Rector to reopen what has been concluded by the council. See also ARO vs. FABOLUDE (1983) 2 SC 9 at 83 and CHIEF ADOMBA & 3 ORS. vs. ODIESE & 3 ORS. (1990) 1 NWLR (Pt. 125) 165 at 178. Counsel submitted further that the Rector purported to act in excess of her authority. This is owing to the fact that there was no place in the Council's meeting that it recommended any further punishment or any issue at all on the meeting to the Rector or any other authority. He urged the Court to consider the same malice shown by the Rector in the earlier application before this court in Suit No. NICN/OW/67/2014. In the circumstance counsel urged the court to hold that issue number one has been answered in the affirmative and therefore succeeds. On issue number two, the Court was urged to take judicial notice of a known fact that Boards and Council of Federal Government Parastatal and Institutions were dissolved in July 2015.Therefore at the time the Rector purported to act there was no council in existence. Also,the letter of suspension did not indicate any misconduct. It was issued for an "alleged misconduct"of "express orders forbidding wire-tapping devices" where no such express or oral order existed. Counsel submitted that section 17 (2) Federal Polytechnic Act 2004 Cap F17 does not apply in the instant case because no one has determined that there was a misconduct. If there was one, but without conceding the Council under Section 17(1) had dealt with and therefore the Rector's opinion or discretion is ousted. Secondly, the alleged act even if is true does not amount to a misconduct under the Act. Again, it is the submission of Counsel that the Applicant who is senior staff in a statutorily regulated employment can only be regulated and guided according to that statute. See the following cases: 1. SANUSI vs. ALHAJI AYOOLA & ORS. (1992) NWLR (Pt. 265) 275 2. FEDERAL MEDICAL CENTRE ADO EKITTI & 2 ORS vs. OMIDIORA KOLAWALE (2012) All FWLR (Pt. 653) 1999 at 2011. 3. BAMGBOYE vs. UNILORIN & ANOR (1999) 10 NWLR (Pt. 622) 290 Counsel submitted that the Rector cannot lawfully act for a dissolved council; she cannot also substitute her opinion for the provisions of the Act. She lacks the vires to do so. This issue, counsel submitted should be resolved in favour of the Applicant. Finally, it is the argument of Counsel that it amounts to double jeopardy to have the Applicant suspended from her duties on half salary despite having been made to apologize and which apology was accepted by the Council, her phone and the so called wire-tapping device confiscated and later returned to her. He submitted further that the law seriously frowns at punishing an offender twice on the same set of facts. See the case of NIGERIAN ARMY vs. AMINU KANO (2010) LPELR-2013 SC. Counsel urged the Court to resolve this last issue again in favour of the Applicant and grant all the reliefs of the Applicant by quashing the suspension letter of 12th October 2015, recall the Applicant to her duties with the Respondent, and order the payment of her salaries and entitlement illegally deducted from her by the Respondent. In opposition, the respondent's counsel filed a 25 paragraph Counter affidavit deposed to by Amanze Honourine Nneka (Mrs.), an Assistant Registrar with the respondent. In the accompanying written address, counsel distilled a sole issue for determination, which is: Whether the Rector of the Respondent institution acted within the enabling Rules of the contract of service the Applicant had with the Respondent in the manner the Applicant was suspended on 13th October 2015. Counsel argued that the Applicant was wrong in its submission that the Respondents Rector had no power to suspend an employee of the Polytechnic whether at all or in the manner and circumstance of this case. See paragraphs 4(b)(i)(ii), 4(c)(i), 12 and 23 of the Counter Affidavit. He argued further that the issue in this matter is pre-trial and not post-trial suspension and the Rules governing its contract of employment has a provision for pre-trial suspension and vests the power to impose such pre-trial suspension on two Authorities of the Respondent Polytechnic viz; (a) The Governing Council - See Section 17 (3) of the Federal Polytechnic Act 2004. (b) The Rector - See also Section 17 (2) Federal Polytechnic Act 2004.s`,

    judge: 'Idris Legbo Kutigi , Aloysius Iyorgyer Katsina-Alu',

    judgement_delivered: `This appeal is against the ruling of the Ibadan Division of the Court of Appeal on the 14th of January 2001. The ruling is at pages 57-83 of the record. The motion sequel to which the decision was given, filed on the 15th of February 2000 prayed for the following orders:- (a) to set aside ex debito justitiae, the writ of execution dated 16th July 1999 issued out of the Oyo State High Court; (b) to set aside execution of the judgment wrongly carried out on 21st July, 1999 in pursuance of the said writ of execution; (c) to restrain the respondent from taking further steps in the levying of execution against the properties of the Defendants/Appellants/Applicants; and (d) to direct the Sheriff of the Oyo State High Court to release the Daewoo Racer car No OYO AE 178 DDA attached pursuant, to the said writ of execution. The ground for the application was stated to be as follows:- \"The ground for the application is that the judgment debt was duly deposited with the Deputy Chief Registrar of the Court of Appeal on 15th July 1999 as ordered by this Honourable Court.' In granting the application, the Court per Adekeye (JCA) at page 80 concluded as follows:- \"Consequently, this application succeeds. All the reliefs except (c) are granted. The issuance of the writ by the High Court Ibadan on 16/7/99 is set aside, so also is the execution of the same writ on the 21/7/99. The car AE 178 DDA wrongly attached by the bailiff of the High Court Ibadan in the process of execution of the writ shall be and is accordingly released to the applicants.\" Earlier in the ruling, the lower Court examined relief (c) in considerable details and concluded at page 79 of the record that in view of the subsisting order for conditional stay of execution granted on the 2nd February 1999, granting another order of restraint of the Respondent/Appellant would be merely superfluous. The Notice of Appeal dated 14th February, 2001 contained two grounds of appeal. In the Appellants\' Brief settled by Chief Akin Olujimi. SAN, the following two issues for determination were formulated:- '(a) Whether in the absence of an appeal against the order of the High Court directing that the attached car be returned to the custody of the High Court, the Court of Appeal could on a mere application order the release of the car. (b) Whether the Court of Appeal acted validly in setting aside the execution levied on the Respondent\'s car.' In the Respondent's brief prepared by Babatunde A. Aiku SAN, only one issue was formulated for determination and it is:- \"Whether in view of the available materials and the state of the law, the lower Court was right in making an order for the release of the 1st Respondent's Daewoo Racer Saloon Car attached after payment of the judgment debt'\" The Appellant\'s issue (a) raises the question of the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal over the application. While the Appellant\'s issue (b) is to the same effect as the Respondent\'s single issue. It is whether in view of the circumstances of the case the Court of Appeal was right in setting aside the High Court\'s issuance of the writ of execution on the 16/7/99 and the order of execution made on the 21/7/99. The focus of the arguments of learned Senior Counsel in both the Appellant\'s Brief filed on the 15/5/2001 and the Appellants Reply Brief filed on 15/4/2005 is that there was no appeal against the order of the Oyo State High Court by which a writ of execution was issued on the 16th of July 1999 for the attachment of the 1st Respondent\'s Daewoo Racer Saloon car. Learned senior counsel referred to the reliefs sought and granted which were not expressed to be granted pending the determination any appeal and submitted that the Court below purported to exercise original jurisdiction in entertaining the motion and which original jurisdiction it does not have. It was further submitted that section 16 of the Court of Appeal Act upon which the lower Court relied to grant the reliefs sought does not vest in that Court any original jurisdiction to entertain the application. On the scope of section 16 of the Court of Appeal Act he relied on Ejehwomu v Edok-Eter Ltd (1986) 5 NWLR (Part 39) 1 at 38 and Ikenna v Bosah (1997) 3 NWLR (Part 494) 439 at 456. It was further contended that the remedy ex debito justitiae bears no application to the facts of this case since it confers no jurisdiction where none is vested. Learned Senior Counsel for the Respondents, justifying the decision of the Court Appeal relied on section 22(2) of the Sheriffs and Civil Process Act, Cap 407, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 1990, and submitted that the execution was superseded by payment of the judgment debt of N106,000.00 on 15th July 1999 pursuant to the order of the lower Court. He cited Akpononu v Bakaet Overseas & Ors (1995) 5 NWLR (Part 393) 42 at 66-67 and Total Nigeria Ltd v Electrical & Mechanical Construction Company Ltd (1972) 8-9 SC 64 at 80. Learned Senior Counsel referred to Alhaji Taofeek Alao v African Continental Bank Ltd (2000) 9 NWLR (Part 672) 264 at 281 and submitted that the remedy ex debito justitiae enabled the Court of Appeal to entertain and grant the reliefs sought. It was submitted that there existed special circumstances in the context of Order 3 Rule 3(4) of the Court of Appeal Rules 1981 for the Court\'s entertainment of the application and grant of the reliefs sought. For the meaning of special circumstances, he relied on Kalu v Odili (1992) 5 NWLR (Part 240) 130 at 172. The facts in a chronological order as can be gleaned from the affidavits, counter affidavits and documents attached thereto are as follows:- On the 2nd of August 1996 the Plaintiff, who is Appellant herein, obtained judgment against the Defendants who are Respondents herein for the sum of N106,000.00 with interest at the rate of 2% until the final liquidation of the judgment debt. The Respondents appealed and while the appeal was pending, filed a motion for stay of execution at the High Court. On the 10/2/98 the stay sought therein was refused. They brought another application for stay at the Court of Appeal. And on the 2/2/99, by consent of both parties, a conditional stay of execution was granted whereby the Respondents were ordered to deposit the sum of Nl06,000.00 in an interest yielding account at the First Bank of Nigeria Plc, Bank Road Branch, Ibadan in the name of the Deputy Chief Registrar of the Court of Appeal Ibadan with 45 days of the grant of the said order. On the 17/3/99 before the expiration of the 45 days, the Respondents herein filed another application for variation of the stay earlier granted. By its ruling on the 15/7/99 the Court below refused the variation sought. In the said ruling, the Court stated in unequivocal terms that the 45 days within which to comply with its order of the 2/2/99 had not lapsed since the application for variation filed on the 17/3/99 was less than 45 days. On that same 15/7/99, the Respondent\'s herein deposited the said sum of N106,000.00 in compliance of the Court\'s Order. This was evidenced in Exhibits \"C\" and \"D\" attached to the affidavit in support of the motion. However, on the 16/7/99 the Appellant applied to the High Court of Oyo State for the issuance of a writ of execution for the attachment and sale of the movable properties of the Respondents and same was issued. On the 21/7/99, the Respondent\'s car was attached by officials of the High Court pursuant to the writ earlier issued. Representations showing evidence of the deposit of the sum of N106,000.00 in the bank in the name of the Deputy Chief Registrar of the Court of Appeal were made to the then Chief Judge of Oyo Stale on whose intervention the car was released to the 1st Respondent. Following this release of the car, application for committal was made to the High Court which accordingly convicted the 1st Respondent and the Sheriff of the High Court for contempt. The first issue that calls for determination is that of the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to entertain the application. The argument of learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant, which substance I have stated above, was premised essentially on this issue of jurisdiction, He did not address the issue raised by the Respondents as to whether section 22(2) of the Sheriffs and Civil Process act Cap 407 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria also confers jurisdiction on the Court of Appeal to entertain the application. As stated in the heading of the motion paper, Section 22(2) of the Sheriffs and Civil Process Act is one of the laws upon which the application is founded.`,

Without their particulars, they read as follows: Ground One \"The Court of Appeal erred in law in striking out the Appellant\'s appeal on the basis of the 1st Respondent\'s objection without considering the Appellant\'s Counsel\'s arguments on the objection as canvassed on 22 - 11 -2000\". Ground Two The Court of Appeal erred in law when it held per Amiru Sanusi J.C.A. as follows: \"From the facts of the instant case it is not in dispute that this appeal is on interlocutory matter since it is not on final judgment of the court. It is trite law that an appeal against a decision of High Court on interlocutory matters lies in the Court of Appeal as of right where it relates to question of law. But where the appeal is on ground other than that of law, only then, prior leave of the High Court or the Court of Appeal must be sought and obtained. Failure to obtain such leave would render the appeal incompetent (sic) (See section 221) (1) of the 1979 Constitution. See also Akwiwu Motors Ltd. v Sangonuga (1984) 5 SC 184 Anaghelu v Oraelosi (supra). Nwosu v Offor (supra). It is equally clear from the facts of this case that the Appellant in this case did not seek for and obtain leave of the lower court or this Court before bringing this appeal which as I said is on an interlocutory matter. Thus, in the light of all that I have said above I see merit in the first leg of the preliminary objection. I therefore uphold the 1st leg of the Respondent\'s objection. I, as such, hold that the Appellant\'s failure to obtain leave from either the lower court or this Court renders the appeal incompetent. I therefore uphold the objection and strike out the appeal\". Ground Three The Court of Appeal erred in law when it held per Amuri Sanusi. J.C.A. as follows: \"Having so held (sic) I do not see any use in dealing with the issues for determination raised by the Appellant in the appeal. I therefore hereby strike out the appeal with N5000.00 costs against the Appellant in favour of the Respondent\". The facts of the case briefly stated are that the 1st Respondent was an Employee of the Appellant. Allegations of financial misappropriation and/or improper and unapproved grant of overdraft facilities to some named customers at the Branch where the 1st Respondent, worked were made. The 1st Respondent, who was on leave, was recalled to appear and answer questions from the Auditors of the Appellant. He duly attended and after hearing from him, he was later interdicted and placed on suspension during which period, he was asked to report to the Police - i.e. the 2nd Respondent. On the strength of the allegations, the Police detained the 1st Respondent in the course of their investigation. Eventually, the police found the said allegations against the 1st Respondent, not substantiated and in consequence, released him. On his release, the 1st Respondent took out an Originating Motion Ex-Parte at the High Court of Lagos seeking the leave of that Court, to enforce his fundamental right to personal liberty. On 18th October, 1999, that court, granted leave to him to apply to enforce his said Fundamental Right. The Appellant, dissatisfied with the said grant or decision, appealed to the Court of Appeal (hereinafter called \"the court below\") on a lone ground of appeal. Briefs were filed and exchanged. In the 1st Respondent\'s Brief, he raised and argued a Preliminary Objection as to the competency of the appeal, on the ground, that the said one ground of appeal having regard to the \"Particulars of Error\", was one of mixed law and fact. That since prior leave of the court was neither sought nor obtained, the court below, was urged by the 1st Respondent, to strike out the appeal. After hearing the learned counsel for the parties on 22nd November, 2000, the court below in its said Judgment, upheld the Preliminary Objection and accordingly, struck out the appeal of the Appellant. It is against that decision that the Appellant has appealed to this Court. The Appellant, has formulated two (2) issues for determination, namely, \"1. Whether an appeal against the decision of a High Court granting leave to enforce the Fundamental right to personal liberty is as of right or must be with leave under the 1999 Constitution. 2. Whether the 1st Respondent\'s action in the High Court of Lagos State would not have been liable to be struck out if the court below had considered the merits of the appeal before it\". On its part, the 2nd and 3rd Respondents, formulated also two (2) Issues for determination, namely, \"1) Whether the sole ground of appeal at the court below was of mixed law and fact such as to require the leave of that Court or of the trial Court for the appeal which was an interlocutory appeal to be competent. 2) Whether the court below was duty bound to pronounce on all issues raised in the substantive appeal after upholding the preliminary objection to the competence of the appeal before it\". I note that the subject-matter of the application to enforce an alleged Fundamental Right is strictly one of Master and Servant. But this is not the issue here. It is in fact, to enforce the Fundamental Right to personal liberty. Again, this is not the issue in the instant appeal. I note that in paragraph 4.2 of the Appellant\'s Brief, the Appellant concedes that the Order made by the High Court of Lagos State on 18th October, 1999 - granting leave to the 1st Respondent (who I note, did not file a Brief nor was he represented in this appeal) was an interlocutory Order in that or because, it did not finally determine the rights of the parties. The cases of Olatunde v. Obafemi Awolowo University & anor. (1998) 5 NWLR (Pt.549) 178 at 186 (it is also reported in (1998) 4 SCNJ. 59; Balogun v. Adejobi (1995) 2 NWLR (Pt.375) 131 at 161 and Akinsanya v. U.B.A. (1986) 4 NWLR (Pt. 39) 273 at 293 are cited and relied on in respect thereof. It is also conceded by the Appellant in its paragraph 4.3 of the Brief, that an application for leave, involves the exercise of discretion by the trial court. The cases of Bank of Ireland v. Union Bank of Nigeria Ltd. & anor. (1998) 10 NWLR (Pt.569) 178 @ 192) (it is also reported in (1998) 7 SCNJ. 385) and Maigoro v. Garba (1999) 10 NWLR (Pt. 624) 555 at 568 are cited and relied on in respect thereof. I agree with the Appellant in its paragraph 1.1 of the Brief that \"this is a very simple and straight forward appeal\"`,

    judgement_delivered: `The appellant was the defendant in Suit No ADSY/25/93 instituted by the respondent as plaintiff in the High Court of Adamawa State, Yola Judicial Division. The defendant was an accredited distributor of the Anambra Motor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (Anamco for short). The parties entered into a contract for the sale of two Mercedes Benz Trucks, Model L.911/48C by the defendant to the plaintiff at a unit cost of &#8358;846,259.20. The plaintiff paid a total of &#8358;l,692,519.40 for the two vehicles with a bank draft. When the defendant failed to deliver the vehicles, the plaintiff commenced proceedings leading to this appeal. Pleadings were ordered, filed and exchanged. In paragraph 12 of its amended statement of claim the plaintiff averred as follows: 12. Whereof the plaintiff claims against the defendant: (a) The sum of one million six hundred and ninety two thousand, five hundred and nineteen naira, forty kobo being the money originally paid to the defendant for the delivery of the two Mercedes L.911/48C trucks and the additional sum of four million, three hundred and seven thousand naira which the plaintiff will have to add to the sum originally paid to the defendant if the plaintiff were to buy the two trucks in the open market. (b) In the alternative to (a) above an order of this Hon. Court to compel the defendant to deliver to the plaintiff two new Mercedes trucks L.911/48C model. (c) An order of this Hon. Court compelling the defendant to pay interest on the sum of &#8358;1,692,519.40 at current bank rate to the plaintiff from the month of March 1993 until judgment is delivered.' The plaintiff's case as disclosed in the pleadings and from the evidence is that in February 1993, it placed an order with the defendant for the purchase of two Mercedes Benz trucks Model L.911/48C at a unit price of &#8358;846,259.20 totaling &#8358;1,692,517.40 excluding 1'% commission payable on delivery of the goods. The plaintiff duly paid for the two trucks and the money was remitted to Anamco. Subsequently, the defendant by a letter dated 31st March, 1993 (exhibit 'R.S.1') informed the plaintiff that the prices of the vehicles had been reviewed upwards to &#8358;1,500,000.00 per truck and requested the plaintiff to remit an additional sum to make up the increased price. As a matter of fact, the defendant had on 13th April, 1993 collected the two trucks from Anamco at the old rate as evidenced by invoice No 9390 (exhibit 'R.S.3') and instead of delivering them to the plaintiff, the defendant sold them to a third party, Leventis, on the pretence that the plaintiff did not pay the additional sum requested by the defendant. It was part of the plaintiff\'s case that the money which he paid for the trucks was raised from his bankers and he was charged interest at the rate of 35% from 1993 to 1994 and 21% thereafter and that the price of the trucks had gone up to &#8358;3,000,000.00 per truck. The defendant\'s case was that the price of the trucks in question as at 1st February, 1993 was &#8358;2,039,180.00 at the rate of &#8358;1,019,590 each and that the plaintiff paid &#8358;1,692,519.40 which was not up to the total cost of the trucks. It was further averred that the price list of Anamco (exhibit 'RS4') was subsequently reviewed upwards to &#8358;3,000,000 less 8.5% for the two trucks and that as a result, a letter dated 5th May, 1993 (exhibit 'R S 5') was addressed to the plaintiff to pay an additional sum of &#8358;1,052,480.60 to cover the full costs of the two vehicles or elect to pay for one truck only and be refunded the balance of &#8358;320,019.40k of the money it had already paid. As the defendant did not hear from the plaintiff, it forwarded a draft (exhibit 7A) to the plaintiff with a letter dated 26th June, 1993. This was in refund of the money paid by the plaintiff and that the plaintiff refused to accept the refund. The defendant admitted taking delivery of the vehicles from Anamco on 13th April, 1993 and sold them to other customers. At the conclusion of hearing, the learned trial Judge evaluated the evidence. He found for the plaintiff as follows: (a) &#8358;1,692,519.40 being the price which plaintiff paid to the defendant for the two vehicles and (b) &#8358;300,000.00 as damages. Items (a) and (b) totaled &#8358;1,992,519.40 with interest on &#8358;1,692,519.40 at 5% simple interest from 1st March, 1993 to 31st March, 1995 and interest on the total judgment debt from 20/4/95, the date of judgment with interest. He entered judgment for the plaintiff accordingly. The learned trial Judge found as a fact that the purchase price agreed by both parties was &#8358;846,259.20 and that the plaintiff paid &#8358;1,692,519.40 representing the price of the two trucks. He also found that the defendant took delivery of the two trucks from Anamco on 13/4/93 and that its failure to deliver them to the plaintiff that day or the day after was wrongful. Dealing with the alternative claim for specific performance, he referred to Section 52 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1893 and held that as the trucks in question were not 'specific or ascertained,' the plaintiff was not entitled to specific performance. As to the claim for damages, the learned trial Judge referred to Section 51(3) of the Sale of Goods Act, 1893 and held that the plaintiff is entitled to the sum of &#8358;1,692,519,40 which it paid and that it failed to prove its actual loss at the time the defendant defaulted in delivering the vehicles. He nevertheless awarded &#8358;300,000.00 as damages. The plaintiff was not satisfied with the judgment and it appealed to the Court of Appeal, Jos Division. Its complaints were that the learned trial Judge refused to make an order of specific performance and also the inadequacy of damages awarded. The court below dismissed the appeal on specific performance and allowed that on damages holding that the learned trial judge ought to have awarded the plaintiff the sum of &#8358;1,307,480.60 being the difference between the contract price of the two trucks (&#8358;1,692.519.40) and their market or current price of &#8358;3,000,000.00 as at 13/4/93 when the defendant defaulted in delivering them to the plaintiff. Dissatisfied with the judgment of the court below, the defendant appealed to this court. It filed three grounds of appeal and obtained the leave of this court to file and argue grounds of fact and mixed law and fact. The only issue formulated by the defendant from the three grounds of appeal as arising for determination is whether the court below was right after finding the plaintiff\'s evidence on damages inconsistent and/or contradictory, to have reviewed the same damages of &#8358;l,992,519.40 awarded by the trial court to &#8358;3,000,000.00 by placing reliance on the pleadings of the parties. The learned counsel for the defendant in his brief of argument submitted that for a party to obtain relief on special damages, such relief must specifically be pleaded and proved. He referred the court to paragraphs 6 and 11 of the amended statement of claim filed by the plaintiff and argued that the defendant specifically denied them in its statement of defence. He specifically mentioned paragraph 10 of the statement of defence and that on a complete reading of the statement of defence, it cannot be said that the defendant admitted that the plaintiff is entitled to the damages claimed. It was further submitted that in paragraph 11 of the amended statement of claim the plaintiff claimed six million naira as current price of 2 Mercedes Trucks due for delivery to it, that this paragraph was clearly denied in paragraphs 3 and 15 of the statement of defence and that the denial put the plaintiff to strict proof of the damages claimed. The court was also referred to Section 51(3) of the Sale of Goods Act, 1893. It was also submitted that the plaintiff did not plead the price of the trucks at the time of the refusal to deliver. It was contended that even if the pleadings were held to avail the plaintiff, it was wrong for the court below to have reviewed the damages awarded for the sole reason that there was an admission on the pleadings and that the court was also in error to have considered paragraph 10 of the statement of defence in isolation and without regard to paragraphs 2 and 15 thereof. The case of Titiloye v Olupo (1991) 7 NWLR (Part 205) 519, (1991) 9-10 SCNJ 122 at 124 and 125 was cited in support of counsel\'s contention. It was further contended that the plaintiff called two witnesses in proof of damages and that the court below rightly found their evidence to be 'conflicting', 'contradictory' and 'contrary to pleadings', that PW1 and PW2 gave inconsistent evidence of the current price of the trucks and that the same court should not have proceeded to find an admission in exhibit 'RS 1' which was tendered through the plaintiff and which exhibit gave the price as &#8358;l,500,000.00 per vehicle, an amount which the same court found to be in conflict with the evidence. It was finally submitted that the case of the plaintiff at the trial by its amended statement of claim was for &#8358;6,000,000.00 as cost of the trucks at the time of trial, that it is trite that a party is not permitted to change his case on appeal faced with the consequences of inconsistent, unreliable and contradictory evidence it called and to change its entire case relying on an admission which was never its case. We were referred to the case of Imana v Robinson (1979) NSSC 1 at 11 on what strict proof entails. The court was urged to hold that given the findings of the court below on the evidence led by the plaintiff and the position held by the defendant in its pleadings, the court below was in error to have increased the damages awarded by the trial court and that the appeal should be allowed.`,

    judgement_delivered: `The appellant was convicted at the High Court, Ogoja of the murder of Cyril Bishung and was sentenced to death. He appealed to the Federal Court of Appeal against conviction and the appeal was dismissed. He has now appealed to this Court. The facts before the trial court, which were not in dispute, may be summarised as follows. On 16th December, 1975 both the appellant and the deceased took part in a football match after which there was hot argument between them. The appellant returned to his room at Front Line Hotel, Obudu. Not long afterwards the deceased went to the hotel and met the appellant in the room. A fight ensued between them in the room. The fight, according to the appellant, lasted about ten minutes. The time was about 7 p.m. P.W.2, James Akpagu was an eyewitness to the fight. He said in evidence that he had gone to the \"generator room\" of the hotel to switch on the hotel electric plant when he heard some noise coming from the appellant\'s room. He went to the room and found the deceased and appellant fighting. He attempted separating the fight but in vain. One Godwin Uka came to the room and with his assistance the fight was stopped and the deceased was pushed out of the room. The appellant then got hold of a stick to chase the deceased. P.W.2 tried to stop the appellant, but the appellant shouted at him saying \"let me alone to pursue him\". The appellant then went after the deceased P.W.2 came out of the Front Line Hotel but could not see the appellant. He, on information received, ran to Port Harcourt Street where he found the deceased lying on the ground. The deceased called on him for help and asked the witness to get his (deceased\'s) father to the scene. Meanwhile one Justina Azikpu, P.W.5, who had seen the deceased on the ground requested Timothy Agida, P.W.4, to take the deceased to the hospital. P.W.4 picked the deceased on his motor cycle and took him to the police station instead. The police then took the deceased to the Sacred Heart Hospital, Obudu, where the latter was admitted by a doctor for observation. The doctor testified as P .W.1 and said: On 16/12/75 I admitted at about 8.30 p.m. one Cyril Bishung into hospital. Cyril had a small laceration on the bridge of the nose, and another laceration on the right eyebrow. I observed that the right eyelid was grossly swollen. His general condition was good at the time of admission. He was admitted for observation. On 17/12/75 his general condition was satisfactory. On 18/12/75 he had transcient episodes of restlessness and was semi-comatose at times. At 9.40 p.m. of 18/12/75 he died. I next performed a post-mortem examination on 19/12/75 at 8 a.m. I found upon dissection of the skull linear slightly depressed fracture of the frontal bone, just above the nose and another depressed fracture on the right eye brow. There was communited fracture of the right orbital plate, with displacement of splinter fragment, also observed extradural haemorrhage of the frontal orbital bone. In my opinion cause of death was the above-stated injuries on the head. In his defence, the appellant testified and said that when the deceased tried to run out of his (appellant\'s) room in the Front Line Hotel, he (deceased) knocked his face against the frame of the door. This evidence was earlier mentioned in the appellant\'s statement to police made under caution, which was put in evidence by the prosecution as Exhibit 1 and was subsequently adopted by the appellant in the course of his evidence-in-chief. The relevant portion of Exhibit are ads: During the struggle, when he got up, and was trying to run out of the house he hit his face on the frame of my door and sustained injury. The only point taken before us by learned counsel for the appellant was that in view of the inconsistency in the evidence of the doctor that performed the autopsy (P.W.1) there was no sufficient circumstantial evidence which could be said to have irresistibly led to the inference by the learned trial judge that it was the appellant that caused the death of the deceased. In support of this contention learned counsel for the appellant referred us to the evidence of the doctor given under cross-examination, where she said: All the head injuries are due to heavy direct force; These ones are consistent with injuries caused if a person ran against a heavy object (italics mine). and also the doctor\'s written report which was tendered for identification by her and later put in evidence by PC Noel Ikpo, P .W. 8, as Exhibit 3. In the report the doctor expressed the following opinion: I certify the cause of death in my opinion to be due to above head injury due to a heavy blow (Italics mine). In his judgment the learned trial judge found as follows: The 1st accused (now appellant) has not also disputed the fact that the deceased had an injury on his head, but explains that the injury was caused when the deceased hit his face on the wooden frame of his door. I do not accept this explanation. The doctor said there were two lacerations on the deceased\'s face, one on the bridge of the nose and the other on the brow of the right eye. Under cross-examination she said the two wounds were due to heavy direct force; in Exhibit 3, her report on the autopsy, she certified that the cause of death was the head injury, (meaning I take it, the two lacerations) due, as she put it, \'to a heavy blow.\' No accidentally self-inflicted injury could, in the circumstances in which the 1st accused said the fight took p lace, result in so grave an injury as those in issue in this case '..I therefore find as a fact that it was the 1st accused who inflicted the injury or injuries on the nose and right eyebrow of the deceased, which injuries occasioned the deceased\'s death on the 18th of December, 1975. The Federal Court of Appeal which considered the issue of the sufficiency of the circumstantial evidence observed ' In the present case as we have already pointed out, the evidence-in-chief of P.W.2 covered these aspects of the inadmissible evidence now complained of by learned counsel for the appellant and it is our view that in no way was the appellant ever prejudiced. This view also applies to the admission of Exhibit 3 the medical certificate of P.W.1. There was no need to have admitted that exhibit in view of the evidence of P.W. 1 herself. We agree with the submission of learned counsel that the only use to which the report might have been made was for the doctor to have been allowed to refresh her memory with it and the defence would then have been entitled to see it and cross-examine on it, in which case it might have been produced in the doctor\'s evidence-in-chief. See David Ifenado v. The State (1967) N.M.L.R. 200 at page 203 (see also Owanso Agbeyin v. The State 1967 N.M.L.R. 129... In spite of the learned trial judges reference to Exhibit 3 from the evidence-in-chief of P.W. 1, we are satisfied that it was proper for him to draw the irresistible inference that the fractures as described could not have been caused by the deceased hitting his face on a wooden door-frame.\" It is significant to observe that the medical report was not, strictly speaking, put in evidence by the doctor, as it was admitted during her testimony for identification only. P.W.8 was the witness who tendered the report when it was admitted as Exhibit 3. So that the present case is distinguishable from the cases of David Ifenado and Owanso Agbeyin (supra) where the medical reports were put in evidence as exhibits proper in the course of the evidence-in-cliief of the medical officers who testified in those cases. In the present case it was not necessary for P.W.8 to tender the medical report since the doctor testified by herself; and furthermore in view of the decisions of this Court in the cases of David Ifenado and Owanso Agbeyin, the effort by the prosecution to put in the report as an exhibit for identification only was an exercise in futility that ought not to have been embarked upon. Be that as it may, since the report was put in evidence by P.W.8 and not the doctor, and it was not challenged as superfluous when so tendered, it was open to the learned trial judge to rely on its contents as he did. Now to return to the submissions of learned counsel for the appellant. In Exhibit 3, as already shown, the doctor stated that the injuries suffered by the deceased were caused by a heavy blow. She made no mention of the cause of the injuries in her evidence-in-chief, except under cross-examination when she said that the injuries were consistent with those caused when a person runs against a heavy object. The divergence of the opinion expressed by the doctor is significant in the light of the case for the prosecution and that for the defence. If the injuries were caused by a heavy blow, that is consistent with the prosecution\'s case, but if on the other hand they correspond with injuries caused by running against a heavy object, that would be in support of the appellant\'s defence that the deceased collided with the frame of the door to the appellant\'s room.`,

Accompanying the complaint is the statement of facts, a list of witnesses and a list of 11 documents to be relied upon together with copies of the documents. In reaction, the defendants entered appearance by filing their memorandum of appearance dated 13th October 2011 but filed on 14th October 2011. The defendants also filed a motion on notice brought pursuant to Order 11 Rule 1 of the National Industrial Court (NIC) Rules 2007 and section 7(1)(a), (b) and (c) of the NIC Act 2006 praying the Court strike out the suit for want of jurisdiction. The defendants, however, did not join issues with the claimant by filing their statement of defence and the accompanying defence processes. In a considered ruling at its sitting of 1st February 2012, this Court ruled that the preliminary objection of the defendants lacked merit and so the Court has the jurisdiction to hear the claims of the claimant in virtue of section 254C of the 1999 Constitution, amended. The defendants were then asked to pay the cost of N20,000 (Twenty Thousand Naira) before the next adjourned date. The Court then ordered that the matter shall proceed to hearing. The Court had, however, at its sitting of 26th October 2011 suo motu raised the issue of its jurisdiction and competence to hear and determine the claims as to reliefs d), i) and j) of the claimant's complaint; whereupon the claimant, at the Court's sitting of 6th December 2011, orally applied to have the said reliefs d), i) and j) struck out.
